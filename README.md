This manual is for educational purposes only.

I am not responsible for any malicious use of this manual.
## Introduction
Hello, my name is Vlad and I want to share with you my observations in the field of information security.

I am far from a professional in this field, I see myself more as a game developer, but nevertheless, I want to tell you how to easily hack almost any account, be it "Instagram", "Facebook", "Twitter" or even "Binance", without much effort or skill.

***I thought for a long time, is it worth writing this manual, will it hurt anyone?***

Again, I hope this guide is not a call to action, it is meant to help you understand how easy it is to get hacked, and to keep you from leaking personal information.

This guide will serve even those people who are far from programming and from IT technologies.

For many people who are even a little bit interested in information security, they are unlikely to learn anything new, nevertheless the simplicity and efficiency of this method is very high and it is impossible to defend against it 100%.

We will talk about ***"Phishing"*** and its ***varieties***.

You can read what ***"Phishing"*** is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing).

## What you need to know:

**As I said before, this method requires almost no skills and knowledge, but will be a plus if you have the following skills:**
* HTML
